# Slideshare-to-pdf
To download a presentation from slideshare we have to sign up to scribd, but with this script you can download any presentation from the slideshare without any signup, provided that you have a good internet connection. The script uses PIL, requests, beautifulsoup, modules to scrape the images from the presentation and then convert it to a pdf file.
